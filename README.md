## About The Project 
Linkclump is a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly open, copy, or bookmark multiple links from any webpage using a simple drag-selection tool. With a focus on efficiency and ease of use, Linkclump helps streamline your workflow by enabling rapid link management. This project is a fork of the original extension by the original author. It has been updated for modern browsers with enhanced functionality and compatibility under Manifest V3 while preserving its core purpose. 

### Key Features 
- **Multiple Actions:** Open links in new tabs or windows, copy them to your clipboard, or add them to your bookmarks. 
- **Drag-Selection Interface:** Easily select multiple hyperlinks with a simple click-and-drag mechanism. 
- **Customizable Options:** Configure key bindings and behavior to match your workflow.
- **Enhanced Compatibility:** Updated for Manifest V3 and modern Chrome browsers.

## Getting Started 

### Installation 
Install Linkclump from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkclump/lfpjkncokllnfokkgpkobnkbkmelfefj). 

### Prerequisites 
For end users, no additional setup is needed. 

For developers looking to build or modify Linkclump, ensure you have: 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if modifying build scripts)
- [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) (for building the extension)

### Build Instructions 
Linkclump uses Apache Ant for its build process. To build the extension, run: 

```sh ant ``` 

Alternatively, you can build using Docker with:

```sh docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/app frekele/ant:1.10.3-jdk8u111 ant -f /app/build.xml ``` 

This process runs tests and creates a zip file ready for upload to the Chrome Web Store. 

## Usage 
After installation, navigate to any webpage, press the configured key (default is **Z** with left-click), and drag to select multiple links. Upon releasing the mouse button, Linkclump will perform your chosen actionâ€”opening links in new tabs or windows, copying them in your preferred format, or bookmarking them. 

## Contributing 
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. For major changes, consider opening an issue first to discuss your ideas.
